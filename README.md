# Demo

- Create a model of 5 books; each with a title, author, publish date
- Display the list of books
- Have a type-ahead search bar that filters results according to any of the book attributes
- allow user to add a new book to the list
- allow user to drag/sort the list results
- add a checkbox, that when clicked, changes all titles to UPPERCASE (display only, not in model)
